Wide World Travel Guides -- part 3: Adding routing

Requirements

Complete part 1 and part 2 first
Use ngRoute to load the HTML for diplaying guide books from a partial into index.html
Setup

Add a partials directory to your existing file structure:

world_wide_travel
 |_ app
 |    |_ controllers
 |    |     |_ bookCtrl.js
 |    |
 |    |_factories
 |    |     |_ guideFactory.js
 |    |
 |    |_ app.js
 |
 |_ data
 |    |_ guides.json
 |
 |_ lib
 |    |_ gulpfile.js (or gruntfile.js)
 |
 |_partials
 |    |_ guide-list.html
 |
 |_ index.html
Instructions

Make a new branch called guide-routing
Include the separate angular-route provider into index.html: <script src="my-path-to-angular-route.min.js"></script>
Inject it into your app as a dependency: var myApp = angular.module("MyAppName", ['ngRoute']);
Setup routing in app.js using the config method: app.config(['$routeProvider'....etc
Remember to remove ng-controller references from index.html. Angular-route will now handle binding controllers to partials.
